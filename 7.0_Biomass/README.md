[LiDAR Surveys over Selected Forest Research Sites, Brazilian Amazon, 2008-2018](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1644)

This dataset provides the complete catalog of point cloud data collected during LiDAR
surveys over selected forest research sites across the Amazon rainforest in Brazil between 
**2008 and 2018** for the Sustainable Landscapes Brazil Project. Flight lines were selected
to overfly key field research sites in the Brazilian states of Acre, Amazonas, Bahia, Goias, 
Mato Grosso, Para, Rondonia, Santa Catarina, and Sao Paulo. The point clouds have been georeferenced,
noise-filtered, and corrected for misalignment of overlapping flight lines. They are provided in 1 km2 tiles.
The data were collected to measure forest canopy structure across Amazonian landscapes to monitor the effects
of selective logging on forest biomass and carbon balance, and forest recovery over time.

## We have  In biome Cerrado: 
```javascript
Total = 321 TilesüìÅ in the  states GO (n=137) and TO (n=184) have dataLidar-flights-ALS. 
                (eg. GO1_A01_2018_LAS_1.laz/ FN3_A01_2014_P17_laz_4.laz)

## The dataLidar Structure in the states in biome Cerrado
In state GO dataLidar (1) are near municipalities (i) S√£o Jo√£o, Itapirapu√£ (*PC*), Trev√¢nia, *line* Buenolandia to Jussara. Thus, region (ii) are near border with the state of Tocantins, are these: Monjolo, Grupel√¢ndia and S√£o Pedro. *PC* - Principal component

Already the second state dataset TO dataLidar (2) are near municipalities: Novo Horizonte, Ja√∫ do Tocantins, Canoeiro, Alvorada, Salva√ß√£o, Angico, Peixe, Novo Nilo, S√£o Val√©rio da Natividade and √Ågua Branca (greater proportion in region South in the state).
