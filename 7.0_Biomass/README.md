# About 
[LiDAR Surveys over Selected Forest Research Sites, Brazilian Amazon, 2008-2018](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1644)

This dataset provides the complete catalog of point cloud data collected during LiDAR
surveys over selected forest research sites across the Amazon rainforest in Brazil between 
**2008 and 2018** for the **Sustainable Landscapes Brazil Project**. Flight lines were selected
to overfly key field research sites in the Brazilian states of Acre, Amazonas, Bahia, Goias, 
Mato Grosso, Para, Rondonia, Santa Catarina, and Sao Paulo. The point clouds have been georeferenced,
noise-filtered, and corrected for misalignment of overlapping flight lines. They are provided in 1 km² tiles.
The data were collected to measure forest canopy structure across Amazonian landscapes to monitor the effects
of selective logging on forest biomass and carbon balance, and forest recovery over time.

## The dataLidar Structure in the states and municipalities in biome Cerrado
In state GOIAS-GO dataLidar (1) are near municipalities (i) São João, Itapirapuã (*PC*), Trevânia, *line* Buenolandia to Jussara. Thus, region (ii) are near border with the state of Tocantins, are these: Monjolo, Grupelândia and São Pedro. *PC* - Principal component

Already the second state dataset TOCANTIS-TO dataLidar (2) are near municipalities: Novo Horizonte, Jaú do Tocantins, Canoeiro, Alvorada, Salvação, Angico, Peixe, Novo Nilo, São Valério da Natividade and Água Branca (greater proportion in region South in the state).
