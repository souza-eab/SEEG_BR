# About SEEG_BR 
We present a method to spatially allocate all of the emissions and removals due to land conversion in Brazil at high spatial and temporal scales. The method presented here is based on the framework of the National Communications, considering the processes quantified, the equations, emission factors, carbon stocks, and annual increments, but improves on the spatial information over which all calculations are applied. 

## Workflow
   
   Folders ðŸ“‚ are organized by key-steps  âœ¨ and contain a set of codes {} following the SEEG_BR_Munipality classification scheme:
