  <h1>  Three decades of greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with land use change in Brazil** </h1>
</div>

Developed by [Instituto de Pesquisa Ambiental da Amaz√¥nia - IPAM](https://ipam.org.br/)<br>


## SEEG_BR 

  We present a method to spatially allocate all of the emissions and removals due to land conversion in Brazil at high spatial and temporal scales. The method presented here is based on the framework of the National Communications, considering the processes quantified, the equations, emission factors, carbon stocks, and annual increments, but improves on the spatial information over which all calculations are applied.
